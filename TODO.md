# Todo list
## Features
  - finish readme
  - more safety checks
  - fix videoplayer (or scrap it)
  - be able to change text size
  - change text scrolling
  - translation (with deep_translator from pypi?)
  - better settings menu/colors in general (also not relying on pixel sizes with .wm_geometry())(stop using black on white on grey)

## Bugs
  - after closing settings menu the correct model name is not shown once reopened (the model name in previous_model.txt is?)
